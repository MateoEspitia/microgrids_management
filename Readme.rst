MicrogridManagement
========

This package uses linear programming to generate a future state of operation of the energy generation and storage units within an isolated microgrid.

Multiple generation units of different technologies (Solar, Wind, Diesel, etc.) are considered. The amount of energy generated by each unit in a defined time horizon is calculated.

Demand forecasts and environmental variables are used to optimize the health of the microgrid components at the lowest possible cost.


Setup
******
The package is compatible with Python version 3 or higher only.
The user is expected to have installed pyomo before running the package.
Go to http://www.pyomo.org for more information.

1. Switch to a proper directory and then type:

::

    git clone https://github.com/SENECA-UDEA/microgrids_management.git

2. Go into the microgrids_management folder

::

    cd microgrids_management

3. Install the package with the setup.py file:

::

    python setup.py develop


4. For a quick-first run :


::

    python -m TempScen -da "../data/results.csv" -gr 5 -gc 8 -cn "ARX" -s_end "2019-11-05 23:00:00-05:00" -s_start "2019-11-05 00:00:00-05:00" -i_start "2019-10-31 00:00:00-05:00" -sn "gurobi"

* You need to install a Quadratic solver such as "Gurobi": www.gurobi.com/ (e.g Gurobi, Cplex, SCJP, etc.)
